The application uses the latest flutter and dart framework. All the details about the versions should be available in pubsec.yaml file.

The web Page Interface is designed in large screen. So it may not be as responsive in small screen as I would like it to be.
fonts and images are in assets file as required by the project.

The web page was designed using flutter framework in Android Studio in a windows environment.
